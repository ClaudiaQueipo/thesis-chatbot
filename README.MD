# RASA CHAT/VOICE BOT 
This Chatbot allows users to comunicate with it through chat and
voice channels. It was developed using the RASA framework and has a custom API developed with FAST-API. The Chatbot uses a Whisper model for audio synthesis.

## üë∑‚Äç Installation
The first thing we must do is run the command:

```bash
python pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ü§ñ Train the bot
To train the chatbot, open up your console and navigate to the folder where you have saved your project. Then, run the command 
```bash
cd rasa_bot
```
to navigate to your project directory. Once there, run
```bash
rasa train
``` 
to train your language model.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Action Deployment:
Once the model is trained, it is necessary to deploy the action server before running your bot. This can be done by running the command 
```bash
rasa run actions
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏èü§ñ Running the Bot:
Then, to run your bot, open another commandline in previous directory. Then, run the command 
```bash
rasa run --cors "*"
``` 
to run your bot in the production environment.

## ‚ö°Ô∏èüé§ Running Whisper 
Finally, open another command terminal and type the command 
```bash
python run.py
```
and wait for the model to start. The Whisper service would then be enabled for use.
